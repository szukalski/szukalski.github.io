## Life Principles

### 1. Embrace Reality and Deal with It

* Be a hyper-realist
  * See things from Top Down
  * Most rewarded things must operate consistently with reality and contribute to the whole
* Evolution drives everything, so maximise your evolution
* Pain + Reflection = Progress
* Aim for 2nd/3rd-order consequences
  * 1st-order is sub-conscious desire
  * 2nd/3rd-order are conscious goals
* Encounter your weaknesses
  * Accept and find ways around them
  * Rely on input of others

#### Summary

1. Don't confuse what you wish were true with what is really true
2. Don't worry about looking good - worry about achieving your goals
3. Don't overweight first-order consequences relative to second- third- order ones
4. Don't let pain stand in the way of progress
5. Don't blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself

### 2. Use the 5-Step Process to Get What You Want Out of Life

1. Have clear goals
2. Identify and don't tolerate the problems that stand in the way of achieving those goals
3. Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes
4. Design plans that will get you around them
5. Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results

### 3. Be Radically Open-Minded

* Two biggest barriers to good decision making are your ego and your blind spots
* Decision making is 2-step process; take in all relevant data, then decide
* Know that you may be wrong
* Use evidence-based decision-making tools

### 4. Understand That People Are Wired Very Differently

* Train the sub-conscious with kindness and persistence to build the right habits

### 5. Learn How to Make Decisions Effectively
