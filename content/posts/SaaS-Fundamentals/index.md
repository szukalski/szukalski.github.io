* Compliance
* Noisy neighbour
* Tiering strategy
* Global reach
* Tenant isolation

### Tenant Profiles

* Don't constrain tenant profiles based on current requirements
* How to meet needs of varying tenants?
* Can you align tenant experience with cost?
* Are there tenant profiles in the market which aren't addressed today?

### Move the business out of siloes

* Bring all parties together:
