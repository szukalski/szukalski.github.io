By the time I left school a very important principle had just begun to penetrate my brain.

That was that life is a stern struggle, and a boy has to be able to stand up to the buffeting and set-backs.

There are many attributes which he must acquire if he is to succeed - > two are vital, hard work and absolute integrity.

To these two I would now add a third - courage. I mean moral courage - not afraid to say or do what you believe to be right.
  
> Bernard L. Montgomery
